## Ethereum Classic

Classic appeared as a fork of main Ethereum chain (right after famous DAO hack) by a community that disagreed to 
alter the blockchain to get back stolen funds.
ETC is still in search of its place in smart contracts world. Some engineering changes are still going under the hood
(like, changing the emission and difficulty retarget algo), and developer tools are being developed. 
No major token crowdsales were made yet, but the community is looking forward to it.

Not incorporated.


## Neo

 NEO (formerly Antshares) is a Chinese answer to Ethereum. Neo is a major player in SmartContracts world and 
 often compared to Ethereum.
